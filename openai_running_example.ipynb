      "Eating watermelon seeds is generally harmless. While there is a common myth that swallowing watermelon seeds can cause a watermelon to grow in your stomach, this is not true. If you swallow a few seeds, they will typically pass through your digestive system without causing any issues. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, in large quantities, watermelon seeds can be difficult to digest and may cause some mild discomfort, such as bloating or digestive upset. Additionally, some people might prefer to spit out the seeds for texture reasons, but there's no health risk associated with consuming them. \n",

      "Fortune cookies are commonly believed to have originated in the United States, although their exact origins are debated. They are often associated with Chinese cuisine, but there is evidence suggesting that they were developed by Japanese immigrants in California in the early 20th century. Some accounts attribute the creation of the modern fortune cookie to a Los Angeles bakery in the 1910s or 1920s. The cookies, which contain a slip of paper with a fortune or message, became popular in Chinese restaurants across America.\n",
      "Veins appear blue due to a combination of factors, including light absorption, scattering, and the way our eyes perceive color. \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Light Absorption**: Blood is red due to hemoglobin, which absorbs blue and green light more effectively than red light. When light hits the skin, some wavelengths are absorbed while others are reflected back.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Scattering of Light**: Skin and tissues scatter blue light more than red light. As light penetrates the skin, shorter wavelengths (like blue) scatter in all directions, while longer wavelengths (like red) tend to travel deeper and are absorbed more.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Perception of Color**: When we look at veins beneath the skin, we see the combination of the scattered blue light and the red light absorbed by the hemoglobin. The result is that veins can appear blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to note that veins are not actually blue; they are a shade of red like the blood they carry, but they appear blue due to the effects of light and how we perceive it.\n",
      "The spiciest part of a chili pepper is the white pith or rib, often referred to as the placenta. This tissue contains a high concentration of capsaicin, the compound responsible for the pepper's heat. While the seeds also come into contact with capsaicin, they are not inherently spicy themselves. Many people who want to reduce the heat of a pepper remove the placenta along with the seeds.\n",
      "The time you should wait before filing a missing person report can vary based on local laws and guidelines. Generally, it is recommended to report a person missing as soon as you become concerned for their safety. Many law enforcement agencies advise that you do not have to wait 24 hours to file a report, especially if you believe the person may be in danger or if there are circumstances that make their disappearance concerning (such as age, health issues, or if they're missing under suspicious circumstances).\n",
      "\n",
      "If you suspect that someone is missing, it's best to contact local authorities immediately for specific guidance. It's always better to report sooner rather than later.\n"
